## About the Project
As students tasked with creating our final project for VJ, we embarked on the challenge of developing a small playable demo for the game [Orbital Bullet – The 360° Rogue-lite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167680/Orbital_Bullet__The_360_Roguelite/). Drawing heavy inspiration from its "Rogue-Like" elements and impressive "3D Orbital/Circular Physics," we sought to replicate its essence. The project was undertaken between November 2023 and January 2024.
